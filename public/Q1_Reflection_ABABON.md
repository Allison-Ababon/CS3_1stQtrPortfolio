# Reflection of ABABON, Allison
## *Number 1* 
### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **Arithmetic Operators** - Operators essentially perform arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication. This was easy for me to understand since we've already discussed this in the previous school year (C++). It is also very straightforward to use and doesn't require much effort to add into code. For example, if you want to add to variables *x* and *y*, then you can simply just type in `x+y`. There were also multiple assessments/exercises where we could put our skills on this topic to a test.

2. **If-else Statements** - This topic was also taught to us last school year. It didn't vary much from C++, so it was easy to use in coding exercises. It is also pretty straightforward and is super useful. There are also many ways to mix other topics with this. An example is mixing arithmetic operators with it like this:
```
if (x == 3) {
    console.log("I like My Chemical Romance");
} else {
    console.log("I like Pierce the Veil");
}
```
3. **Variables** - This topic is especially the easiest and is what I'm most familiar with. There are certain rules needed in naming variables, but it was easy for me to memorize them. The kinds of variables are also easy to understand. Defining variables is also a pretty easy task to do when doing an exercise. All exercises needed to declare variables, so that was pretty good practice.

4. **Input and Output Functions** - This topic was the first new javascript concept that I learned about. It was pretty easy to do once I understood it. Like, we had multiple problem exercises for this and I think that the structure is pretty straightforward. For example, if you want to get input from a user, you can just type in `let x = prompt("Do you like listening to Get Scared?")` and the computer will do the rest for you! It was also really easy for me to memorize the different kinds of functions for this topic and I (think) I was able to really implement my skills for this in the long test well enough.

5. **Ternary Operators** - Understanding ternary operators was kind of hard for me to do at first, but it eventually became easier. We didn't really have much practice exercises for this topic, but I tried to learn it on Google. I looked at some examples of it and eventually got the jist of it!

## *Number 2*
### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **For  Loops** - I think that I need more practice on it because I wasn't really sure on how to use this topic during the Long Test. I knew the structure but I didn't know *when* to use it.

2. **While Loops** - Same goes for while loops: I wasn't really sure on how to use this in the Long Test. At some point I tried to use it, but gave up. We *did* have multiple exercises on this, but I only knew how to do those because the specific instructions that we needed to use while loops were given to us.

3. **Number Methods** - I haven't really mastered this skill. I don't know which method to use, whether it's `Number`, `toFixed()`, or whatever. 

4. **Switch Statements** - The exercise for this was pretty easy, but I don't really think I know how to do it. I understand the concept but I just feel like I'm lacking in practice for this one.

5. **Loop Control Structures** - Out of all the other topics, I feel like this is the one I lack most practice in. I don't really know the difference between `continue;` or `break;`, and I think that I lost most points in the Long Test for questions that involved this topic.

## *Number 3*
### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I intend to start looking for more exercises online, since doing hands-on exercises usually helps me understand topics better rather than just reading a book about it. I'm also going to start asking people who are more skilled in the topics for help. I'm also gonna start reading other people's code and also start helping them, because I think that teaching other people will make me understand topics even more.

## *Number 4*
### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
#### Effective
1. **Graded Exercises** - The graded exercises usually tested a mixture of different topics, allowing me to put my skills to a test. They were also designed very well and helped me develop and nurture my knowledge. For example, the 7th Graded Exercise really helped me understand for loops more (even if not fully), since it allowed us to read another person's code and it also taught me to debug code.

2. **Bonus Activities** - Bonus activities helped me improve my grade, and they also helped me understand the topics since they were usually harder than the graded exercises uploaded in khub.

#### Not Effective
1. **Learning Guides** - Personally, reading the learning guides didn't really give me much benefits in understanding a topic. They *did* teach me the basic structures of some code and topics, but I never really knew exactly *when* to use it. This brings us back to loop control structures and how I failed to actually understand it fully.

2. **Kahoot** - Kahoots are really fun, and for the majority of times they've been very beneficial to me (taking quizzes really helps me understand topics more). There are definitely times where it does get un effective, because I usually just get lost in the competition and started aiming to answer questions in this really fast manner instead of actually trying to understand what the objective is.
