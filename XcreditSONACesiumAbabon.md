# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Fernidand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Allison Ababon, 9-Cesium

1.
* 3 ovals managed by the PSC are now opened for the public.
* The administration of Build Better More program and the building of the Metro Manila Subway.
* The new MATATAG curriculum.

2.
* I thought how Marcos was mostly talking about future plans was weird.
* I also thought how Marcos kept talking about corruption was kind of weird.

3. The SONA this year involved a lot of Marcos' future plans for the development of the Philippines. For ex

4. **Interesting.**
