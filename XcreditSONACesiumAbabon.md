# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Fernidand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Allison Ababon, 9-Cesium

1.
* 3 ovals managed by the PSC are now opened for the public.
* The administration of Build Better More program and the building of the Metro Manila Subway.
* The new MATATAG curriculum.

2.
* I thought how Marcos was mostly talking about future plans was weird.
* I also thought how Marcos kept talking about corruption was kind of weird.

The SONA this year involved a lot of Marcos' future plans for the development of the Philippines. For example, his plans for flood control and the new Metro Manila subway. He had many seemingly opportunistic promises and ideas for our country's future. He also greatly emphasized on the corruption of leaders and how it affected the floods in the Philippines.

Though he gave us a list of his plans, I think that it really lacks proactivity. His words seemed to be more numerical than leaning on narrative. It also seems like pressure response more than anything.

4. **Interesting.**
